    <p class="text">
        The MMC5 contains two pulse wave channels that are identical to the 
        internal pulse channels, except that the two hardware sweep units are missing. It also has an 8-bit DAC, for PCM playback, which is not supported in Famitracker. Playing samples through the MMC5 DAC or the 7-bit mode of the DPCM DAC requires constant attention from the emulated CPU core. This isn't practical with the FamiTracker driver or most drivers used in games.

<p class="text"> A notable game using the MMC5 is Shin 4 -Jin Uchi Mahjong, which also utilized the PCM channel.</p>

    <p class="text">
        Due to the MMC5's sound being a clone of the 2A03 pulses, the instruments used by MMC5 are shared with 2A03.
