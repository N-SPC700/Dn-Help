        This chip was used by Sunsoft, in any FME-7 game, often interchanged with both the Sunsoft FME-7, and 5A. The only time it's audio was used was in Gimmick!. It is actually a YM2149F, a clone of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Instrument_AY-3-8910" target="new">AY-3-8910</a>. This family of chips are capable of generating noise, envelopes, and tone (square waves), and can even mix these two waves together. However, Gimmick! exclusively used the Tone part of the 5B, rendering the rest of the chip's functions unused. As a result, most emulators don't support the extra modes.</p>

<p class="text">This chip, along with the <a href="vrc7.htm">Konami VRC7</a>, was produced by Yamaha, under the product code <b>YM6630</b>.</p>

	<p class="text">The biggest difference from the usual macros in Famitracker are the Noise/Mode macros. These macros are very powerful, allowing one to tweak the settings of how each channel works on a per-channel basis, at whatever time they want. This includes but is not limited to:</p>
	<ul class="text">
		<li>Per-tick mixing control between Envelope, Noise, and Tone</li>
		<li>Macros to define the Noise pitch</li>
		<li>Ability to mix all three modes into one channel (e.g. Noise+Tone, Tone+Envelope, etc.)</li>
	</ul>
